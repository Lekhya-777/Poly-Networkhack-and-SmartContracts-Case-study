# Poly Network Hack and Smart Contracts Case Study

This repository contains a case study and analysis of the **Poly Network hack**, a major smart contract exploit in decentralized finance (DeFi). It also includes related code and findings for learning about blockchain security and vulnerabilities in cross-chain smart contracts.

##  Overview

On **August 10, 2021**, the **Poly Network** — a cross-chain interoperability protocol — was exploited by an attacker who drained approximately **$610 million in digital assets** from the protocol across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. 

Despite being one of the largest exploits in DeFi history, the majority of assets were returned to Poly Network after negotiations with the attacker.
